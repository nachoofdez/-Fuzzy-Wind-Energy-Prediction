# Fuzzy Logic Energy Prediction Model for Wind Farms
This repository presents a fuzzy logic-based predictive model for wind farm energy production, addressing the significance of wind energy, its prediction, integration into the electrical grid, and market price control. The model utilizes Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) and fuzzy inference systems to predict short-term energy fluctuations in wind farms.

## Content
- Presentation_LÃ³gica_Difusa.pdf: Beamer presentation outlining theoretical foundations, practical implementation, and results.
- Trabajo Soft Computing.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook implementing the model in Python using scikit-fuzzy and pymoo libraries.

## Conclusion
The fuzzy logic-based model shows promising results in predicting wind farm energy production based on historical data. Further improvements include incorporating additional factors such as wind direction and humidity, exploring alternative clustering methods, parallelizing genetic algorithms, and utilizing more extensive historical data for training.
